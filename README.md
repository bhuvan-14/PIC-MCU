TRIS Registers: Set pin direction (input/output)

Interrupt-on-Change: PORTB, enables edge or level-triggered logic

Pull-Up Resistors: Integrated on PORTB pins for compact switching circuitry.

**5. Peripheral Modules and Drivers**
The repository contains reusable modules and drivers for:

GPIO: Digital I/O control, PORT, LAT, TRIS access

ADC: 10-bit, 8 channels, programmable voltage reference — for sensing and analog inputs

PWM (CCP1/CCP2): Two 10-bit resolution channels for motor control, dimming, etc.; requires Timer2.

Timers:

Timer0: 8-bit, basic delays/counters

Timer1: 16-bit, supports external clock source

Timer2: 8-bit, for PWM, periodic interrupts

UART (USART): Full-duplex asynchronous comms, supports configurable baud rate, available on RC6 & RC7 for debugging/serial modules

I²C (MSSP): Master/Slave, SCL(RC3), SDA(RC4); used for connecting deeper hardware like EEPROMs, RTCs, sensors

SPI (MSSP): Master/Slave, high-speed synchronous communication; SCK/SDI/SDO on PORTC for fast data transfer.

Other Key Features: Brown-out reset, power saving modes, low-voltage programming.
